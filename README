Introduction
============

This is the implementation of a modified version for the sunspot detection
algorithm described in the article "Automatic Sunspots Detection on Full-Disk
Solar Images using Mathematical Morphology", written by J.J. Curto, M. Blanca
and E. MartÃ­nez.

We also generated an article about our changes and it is currently under
revision. We will make it available as soon as it is ready.

Building
========

Our software build tool is cmake, you also need OpenCV to build this code.
If you run a debian based machine, you can install the dependecies typing
this on command line:

> sudo apt-get install gcc g++ cmake make libcv-dev libhighgui-dev

After that, enter in the build subdirectory and type:

> cmake ..
> make

That's it... Have fun! :)
